                      f. <strong>Change in Amount Authorized</strong>. If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than
                      due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be
                      charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of
                      your Payment Method. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each
                      billing cycle.

                  <p>
                      g. <strong>Auto-Renewal for Subscription Services</strong>. Unless you opt out of auto-renewal, which can be done by contacting us, any
                      Subscription Services you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term
                      originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional rate. To change or resign your Subscription Services at any time, by contacting us.
                      If you terminate a Subscription Service, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current term; your subscription will not be renewed after
                      your then-current term expires. However, you won't be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current
                      subscription period.

                  <p>
                      h. <strong>Reaffirmation of Authorization</strong>. Your non-termination or continued use of a Paid Service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your
                      Payment Method for that Paid Service. We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right
                      to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to
                      use the Paid Service.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      i. <strong>Free Trials and Other Promotions</strong>. Any free trial or other promotion that provides access to a Paid Service must be used within the
                      specified time of the trial. You must stop using a Paid Service before the end of the trial period in order to avoid being charged for that Paid Service.
                      If you cancel prior to the end of the trial period and are inadvertently charged for a Paid Service, please contact us at members@common.com.

                      notice, effective immediately, which may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with your membership. If you wish to
                      terminate your Account, you may do so by following the instructions on the Site or through the Services. Any fees paid hereunder are non-refundable. All

                      modifications, it is also your responsibility to check these Terms of Service periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Services following
                      notification of any changes to these Terms of Service constitutes acceptance of those changes.

                      with respect to the Services. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or
                      eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms of Service will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of
                      either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder
                  </p>

                      b. <strong>Force Majeure</strong>. We shall not be liable for any failure to perform our obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause

                      c. <strong>Assignment</strong>. These Terms of Service are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with our

                      e. <strong>Notices</strong>. Unless otherwise specified in these Term of Service, all notices under these Terms of Service will be in writing and will be
                      deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is
                      electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight

                  <p>
                      f. <strong>No Waiver</strong>. Our failure to enforce any part of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of our right to later enforce that
                      or any other part of these Terms of Service. Waiver of compliance in any particular instance does not mean that we will waive compliance in the future. In
                      order for any waiver of compliance with these Terms of Service to be binding, we must provide you with written notice of such waiver through one of our
                      authorized representatives.
